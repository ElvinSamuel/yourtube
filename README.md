YourTube is a YouTube clone built with NodeJS, Express, Angular, and MongoDB. 

# Purpose

  - This project is a great way for me to solidify my skills as a web developer as well as learn from a far more exprienced dev.
  - Every step of this project has raised additional questions for me, as well as the trouble shooting. 
  - This project is a useful site, as well as a great addition to my portfolio once completed. 
  - This gives me the perfect opportunity to document my questions as I go, as well as solve some basic problems along the way.

# Notes

# Troubleshooting
1) 'npm start' issue -- initially I was having an issue where I couldn't seem to pinpoint why the app was having issues. I found the following:
    1) First I forked Prosper's original github to see if there could be an error somewhere in my own files. I still managed to get the error from his directory.
    2) I had to copy the .env.example file to .env to start it, via the documentation from Prosper's github. Definitely intend to read through documentation in the future for these types of things.
    3) Good news is that there wasn't an issue with my files, I just had an initial issue there.
